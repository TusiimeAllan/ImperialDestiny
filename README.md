# Challenges
A challenge that i can point out is I found a challenge when trying to create an engaging and immersive environment for players to play in and feel immersed. I wanted the game environment to be rich in detail. To overcome this challenge, I decided not to use the ordinary boxes and planes and scouted for a free environment from SketchFab that had the feel i wanted to have in the game.
